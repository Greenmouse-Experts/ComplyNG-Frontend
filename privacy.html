                                        Our website and apps use re-targeting technologies, which we will only use after you have provided your consent. This enables us to show our visitors, who were already interested in our Services, advertisements from us on partner websites. We believe that the display of personalized, interest-based advertising is more interesting and relevant to our customers than advertising that does not have a personal connection. Re-targeting technologies analyse the information we collect about your interactions with each Us as described in relation to marketing above and information obtained from other parties, including your cookies, and display advertisements based on your past web-surfing behavior. We will process your data for re-targeting purposes with your explicit consent. Please click here for further information on cookies and instructions on how to disable re-targeting. Note that our sites generally are not configured to respond to web browser do-not-track signals.

                                Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information
                                At Complyng, We believe You have a right to understand how we protect your applications and data.
                                We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures to protect the data supplied by You and managed by Us against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our security measures are continually improved in line with technological developments. For instance, Complyng has been certified and attested to confirm compliance with ISO 27001, ISO 22301 and SOC 2 Type II standards, by independent auditors, which provides reasonable assurance of Our security and business continuity practices. Unfortunately, and despite all our efforts, no company or service can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
                                Even considering Complyng security endeavours, Our users also play an important role regarding the security of their personal data. The security measures applied on Your assets or the assets of Your company, as well as Your behaviors when using these assets are crucial for maintaining personal data secure. Actions such as defining a weak password to access Our services, not locking Your laptop or mobile device when You left it unattended, or using public assets to login on Our website, all pose a risk. This way, we ask You to take all the necessary precautions in order to avoid security breaches.
                                For more information about how We secure Your information, you can visit our Trust webpage.
